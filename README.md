# Programming for Data Analysis Assignment

A repository for the dataset synthesis project in ATU Programming for Data Analytics 2022

- notes from video
- a real-world example, could be from work or personal life
- 100 data points across at least 4 variables]
- types of variables and their distributions, relationships to each other
- simulate a second dataset based on the original dataset
- you don't need to store the generated data as a CSV, an output withing Jupy is sufficient, so the code could be re-run by the lecturer and produce a similar, but different, output
- most of the work will come in the investigation, as you've seen working with numPy and other packages, it only take a few commands to generate significant amounts of data
- you'll need to look at each variable and wonder what type of distribution it falls into
- this makes half the result of the final module, which is 10 credits, so the project is essentially worth the same as a 5 credit module
