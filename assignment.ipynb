    "The dataset I have used for this assignment, taken from CricInfo's [Statsguru](https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html) query engine, details the match outcome of 153 five-day Test cricket matches played between England and Australia in England, Wales and Australia since the 1st January, 1970. The decision to choose this area to research was taken after reading the chapter \"The Cat That Turned into a Fence\" in Nathan Leamon and Ben Jones' _Hitting Against the Spin: How Cricket Really Works_ (2021, 172-197), which briefly touches on this area as a whole, before conducting some deeper-dives into more specific match scenarios, which are currently beyond my abilities in terms of turning them into a Python project.\n",

    "\n",
    "To gather this data, I ran three queries through the Statsguru engine, and the links to the results of each is documented in the README document. The first of these was simply a list of all innings in matches between England and Australia, at any venue, after the 1st January, 1970. I then modified the search criteria to only search for matches where England won the toss, and used a VLOOKUP function in Excel to add this as columnar data in a CSV file containing the results of the first query. I then did the same with matches where Australia won the toss, just to double-check my query.\n"

    "The variables I've chosen to include here are those that are often regarded as key points in the early stage of the match. In cricket, winning a coin toss offers a team's captain the choice of batting or fielding first, and captains will make this decision based on a number of factors, such as their team's strengths (or their opponent's weaknesses), the weather forecast, or the condition of the pitch. This choice is seen as an immediate advantage, and much pre-match discussion centres around what each captain's likely decision will be. For this reason, I've included the winner of the coin toss, as well as their choice, as variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes the following variables:\n",
    "- <i>start</i>: the first day of the Test match;\n",
    "- <i>host</i>: the location of the match. Some England games are played in Cardiff, hence 'England or Wales'. In the CricInfo engine this is listed as the particular stadium that hosted the match;\n",
    "- <i>toss</i>: the winner of the pre-match coin toss;\n",
    "- <i>choice</i>: the coin toss winner's decision over whether to bat or field first;\n",
    "- <i>bat_first</i>: the team that batted first, the <i>outcome</i> column is grouped from the perspective of this team;\n",
    "- <i>inn1</i>: the respective total in the first innings of the match;\n",
    "- <i>winner</i>: the team that won the match, or 'draw' if neither did;\n",
    "- <i>outcome</i>: the match result from the perspective of the <i>bat_first</i> team. If <i>bat_first</i> equals 'Australia' and <i>winner</i> equals 'England', then <i>outcome</i> equals 'lost'.\n",

Ties, an extremely rare occurrence in cricket, did not occur in a single one of the matches between the two countries in this dataset; indeed they have only occurred twice in the history of Test cricket since 1877, and are notable enough to have a separate [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tied_Test) entry. While ties are an omission from the simulated dataset at the end of this notebook, they are a statistically insignificant omission.\n",

    "The rivalry between England is generally played as part of a bilateral series known as The Ashes, whereby the two teams meet approximately every two years, alternating as hosts. Each series was historically between four and six matches long, but since the mid-1990s has settled on a consistent five-match format. Of the 153 matches that form this dataset, all but six of these matches (all taking place between 1977 and 1988) were contested as part of The Ashes; overall, Australia has hosted 78 games to the 75 in England or Wales. Due to the regularity of the series, as well as the alternation between host countries, this particular variable is best described as binomially-distributed."

    "### The Toss and the Captain's Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "I have chosen 1970 as my starting point as this was the period when ground staff at English cricket grounds were no longer permitted to leave pitches [uncovered](https://www.lords.org/mcc/the-laws-of-cricket/covering-the-pitch). Before this, pitches were not sheltered from any adverse weather once a match started, significantly affecting the conditions of the match, pitch quality, and captain's decisions at the toss. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, a coin toss is the classic example used for demonstrating binomial distribution, but while the decision to bat or field is a binary choice, it is far from binomially-distributed in the same sense as a coin toss. Leamon and Jones (2021, 175) state that:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"The vast majority (89 per cent) of captains who won the toss chose to bat, and this resulted in sides who won the toss having a markedly better chance of winning.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "The same authors argue that this tendency has proven hard to remove in the era of covered pitches, observing that:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"In Tests played between 1980 and 2010, nearly twice as many captains have batted first than have chosen to bowl.\"\n",
    "\n",

This is one of the many things that sets cricket apart from other sports, it is as if a football team scored three times as many goals as their opponent, but the match was deemed a draw because their opponent had less shots on target.\n",

    "At the time of writing, a match between England and Pakistan is almost certainly headed for a draw after an extremely bat-friendly pitch in Rawalpindi produced 657 runs in England's first innings, and over 500 in Pakistan's, leading one cricket writer to opine that, \"Big runs get you headlines - and a few records - but wickets win you matches.\" ([Ehantharajah](https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/pakistan-vs-england-1st-test-rawalpindi-england-feel-the-funk-in-bid-to-overcome-unforgiving-pindi-pitch-1347874), 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to the extracted dataset, a 657 would rank higher than any first-innings total achieved in an England vs Australia fixture since 1970, while Pakistan's 579 would rank 8th in second-innings scores. run query again to see how many of those top scores are declarations, highlighting that theoretical ceiling\n",

    "Place England's 657 in Rawalpindi in context, where does it fall amongst all first innings scores in the extract?, clarify Pakistan's first-innings score\n",
